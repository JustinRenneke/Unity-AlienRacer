# Aliens vs Unifools

This is my final project from a Computer Graphics class at the University of Missouri.

This is a racing game designed in Unity. It supports both standard PC and virtual reality play and was developed and tested using an Oculus DK2.

A few paid assets from the Unity Asset store were used in this project and they have been removed from this repository for copyright reasons, so downloading and attempting to view this project within Unity will not work correctly as is.
